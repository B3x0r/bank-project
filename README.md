# bank-project
Module 2 bank project that uses React, AWS, and everything I used in Module 1.

#### Installation:
 
You could have to get your own AWS account and set up a bucket to put it into, but it would be easier to just check mine out at: https://rebecca-durst-banking-application.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#/
 
#### Usage:
 
You will be able to create an account and keep track account info. You will also be able to withdraw and deposit into "your account".
 
#### Support: 
 
I would just check the website version if you can't get a cloned version to work.
 
#### Roadmap: 
I'd like the website to adjust to the screen size.
 
#### License information:
